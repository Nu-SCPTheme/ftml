/// Generic function to parse upcoming tokens into a container.
///
/// The conditions for how to consume tokens are passed as arguments,
/// which are explained below.
///
/// Normal arguments (from `try_consume_fn`):
/// Obviously, the logger instance, and the current and upcoming tokens.
/// * `log`
/// * `extract`
/// * `remaining`
///
/// The rule we're parsing for:
/// * `rule`
///
/// The tokens we expect at the opening and ending of this container:
/// This will perform an assertion that the current token matches the opening type.
/// * `open_token`
/// * `close_token`
///
/// The tokens we should abort the container on:
/// If one of these is the current token, we will return a consumption failure.
/// * `invalid_tokens`
///
/// The token pairs we should abort the container on:
/// Each of these is a tuple in the form `(previous_token, current_token)`,
/// if they ever are found adjacent during parsing, we will return a consumption failure.
/// * `invalid_token_pairs`
///
/// This will proceed until the closing token is found, at which point the completed
/// container element will be returned, or until an abort is found.
/// If the latter occurs, a `ParseError` is handed back and the parent will attempt the
/// next rule in the list, or the text fallback.
