//! A library to parse Wikidot text and produce an abstract syntax tree (AST).
//!
//! This library aims to be a replacement of Wikidot's Text_Wiki
//! parser, which is presently a loose group of regular expressions
//! (with irregular Perl extensions). The aim is to provide an AST
//! while also maintaining the flexibility and lax parsing that
//! Wikidot permits.
