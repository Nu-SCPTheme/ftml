//! A library to convert Wikidot text source into HTML.
//!
//! This library aims to be a replacement of Wikidot's Text_Wiki
//! module, but with the goals of providing more modular integration
//! and standalone servicing.
//!
//! While backwards compatibility with Wikidot code is one of the aims
//! of this library, there are constructions which are valid in Wikidot
//! but deliberately invalid in ftml. The total scope of all Wikidot code
//! that is valid would almost require a parser nearly identical to the one
//! attempting to be rewritten to cover every edge case, even if supporting
//! such a case is not very useful or sensible.
//!
//! For instance, the following is valid code:
//! ```text
//! > [[div class="test"]
//! > A man, a plan, a canal, Panama.
//! [[/div]]
//! ```
//!
//! However the actual extent of the blockquote intersects with the div, and
//! it essentially is the HTML equivalent of
//! ```text
//! <div class="outer">
//!   <p class="inner">
//!   </div>
//! </p>
//! ```
//!
//! Which is obviously invalid syntax, and can cause issues.
//!
//! Instead the library's parser defines a grammar, which is designed to be
//! compatible with all common Wikidot constructions, or has extensions for
//! situations that are not directly supported. This largely-overlapping but
//! slightly dissimilar specification ("ftml code") aims at being able to
//! _effectively_ replace Wikidot code with minor human involvement to
//! replace malformed original sources.
//!
//! This crate also provides an executable to convert files from
//! the command-line. See that file for usage documentation.
