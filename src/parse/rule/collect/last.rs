use std::ptr;

/// When passed two slices, it returns the last element before the start of the second slice.
///
/// It is intended to have a very narrow usage for users of `try_collect`-based functions,
/// where the previous token to the `remaining` pointer is needed.
///
/// For instance:
/// ```rust
/// let items = vec![4, 6, 0, 3, 1, 7];
/// let first = &items[1..]; /* [6, 0, 3, 1, 7] */
/// let second = &items[3..]; /* [3, 1, 7] */
///
/// let result = last_before_slice(first, second);
/// assert_eq!(result, 0);
/// ```
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This has several assertions:
/// * `first` and `second` must be slices from the same underlying source
/// * `second` must be a subslice of `first`
/// * The slices may not be empty
/// * `first` must have at least one item at the head that `second` does not.
///
/// If any of these are violated, this utility function may panic.
