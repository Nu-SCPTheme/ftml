// Current pest parser grammar are in src/preproc/include.pest
//
// Big TODO note, since includes are kind of roadblocked and annoying:
//
// What do we do about include parsing?
// We need to properly respect the prioritization list,
// for relevant elements this is (in order):
// * Raw      - @@ / @< >@
// * Comments - [!-- --]
// * Includes - [[include]]
//
// Which is kind of difficult to do with the current token-based system.
// Either we need a two-pass parsing system, where the first one is
// raw and comment-aware too (but doesn't act on them), or includes
// are handled at the regular parsing level, and inserted as a string of tokens.
// Which breaks the current (terrible but clever) hacks like [!--{$opt}
//
// All of these minor implementation details in wikitext means the only "true"
// implementation is a pure replica of Wikidot's terrible code. This sucks lol
