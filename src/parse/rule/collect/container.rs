//! Helper code to parse tokens out to generate recursive containers.

/// Generic function to consume tokens into a container.
///
/// This is a subset of the functionality provided by `try_collect`,
/// as it builds `Container`s specifically rather, but still permits
/// passing arguments to specify behavior and reduce boilerplate.
///
/// The arguments which differ from `collect_until` are listed:
/// See that function for full documentation, as the call here
/// mostly wraps it.
///
/// The kind of container we're building:
/// Must match the parse rule.
/// * `container_type`
///
/// The tokens we expect at the opening and ending of this container:
/// This will perform an assertion that the current token matches the opening type.
/// * `open_token`
/// * `close_token`
