**Foundation Text Markup Language**

A Rust library to parse Wikidot code into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
This aims to be a replacement for the aging [Text\_Wiki](https://github.com/gabrys/wikidot/tree/master/lib/Text_Wiki/Text) from Wikidot.
This is an experimental branch to try and have a nearly fully compatible parser for Wikidot, including malformed constructs.
The goal is to utilize a lexer generator, and consume the tokens in a custom parser to handle unusual cases with a lax approach.

In addition to providing the speed and safety benefits of Rust, this also improves maintainability, and allows exposing an AST to consumers
for more advanced analysis and transformation.

The lint `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is set, and therefore this crate has only safe code. However dependencies may have `unsafe` internals.

### Compilation
This library targets the latest stable Rust. At time of writing, that is 1.43.0

```sh
$ cargo build --release
```

You can use this as a dependency by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
ftml = { git = "https://github.com/NuSCP-Theme/ftml", branch = "next" }
```

### Testing
```sh
$ cargo test
```

Add `-- --nocapture` to the end if you want to see test output.

### Usage
There are two primary exports, which are the `preprocess` and `parse` functions.

```rust
fn preprocess(text: &mut String, includer: &dyn Includer) -> Option<IncludeError>;

fn parse<'a>(text: &'a str) -> SyntaxTree<'a>;
```

`IncludeError` is provided to point out which inclusions failed. The passed `text` is
still modified, with the import replaced with an error message to be rendered.

When performing a parse, you will need to first run `preprocess()`, then run `parse()`
on the fully expanded text.
