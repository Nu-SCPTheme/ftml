//! Module for look-ahead checking.
//!
//! This contains implementations of eager functions that try to interpret the
//! upcoming tokens as a particular object (e.g. seeing a `[[` and you see if it's a module).
//!
//! The parser is not disambiguous because any string of tokens can be interpreted
//! as raw text as a fallback, which is how Wikidot does it.
