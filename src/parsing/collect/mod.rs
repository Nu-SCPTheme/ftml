//! Module which contains functions to iterate through tokens and output according to rules.
//!
//! The main function here is `collect()`, which is a generic procedure to perform
//! some action over tokens, finishing or abortion when it reaches certain tokens.
//!
//! The other functions are extensions of `collect()` which perform more specific functions,
//! but still with the same customization.
