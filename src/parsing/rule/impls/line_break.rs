    // This rule is kind of special. It's the same as RULE_LINE_BREAK,

    // paragraphs.
    //
    // So what's going on?
    //
    // In "normal" contexts, you extract paragraphs (see gather_paragraphs()), so any
    // Token::ParagraphBreak tokens are used to affected the ParagraphStack and create
    // a new paragraph container.
    //
    // However other contexts do not allow new paragraphs to form, such as [[span]].
    // In these cases, if we encounter two or more newlines, we must pretend it's simply
    // one regular newline, or a line break.
